# Description Tabular classification

Tabular classification is a supervised type of learning in which a set of data labeled to train an automatic learning model that can predict the class of a new dataset can be used. In the tabular classification, the input and output data is represented in the form of a table with rows and columns, where each row represents an instance or example of the data, and each column represents a characteristic or attribute of the data.

For example, if you want to predict whether a bank of a bank is solvent or not, the characteristics or attributes that can be used are: income, debts, credit history, age, etc. In the tabular classification, each instance or example of the dataset will have values for each of these characteristics and a label that indicates whether the client is solvent or not.

Once you have a set of data labeled, an automatic learning algorithm is used to train a model that can predict the label of new datasets. This model can be used to perform precise and fast predictions on new data instances.

Tabular classification is a very useful technique to solve classification problems in a wide variety of fields, such as medicine, electronic commerce, banking, safety and many others.

# Description Object Identification

The identification of objects in neuronal networks is a technique used in the field of automatic learning and computer vision to detect and recognize objects in images or videos. It is an important task in image analysis and is used in applications such as faces recognition, real -time objects, the classification of objects in medical images and the detection of objects in autonomous vehicles.

The neural networks used for the identification of objects are deep learning models that are trained in datasets labeled. The training process implies providing the neurons network for a large number of images tagged, and adjusting the weights of connections between neurons so that the network can identify objects in new images with high precision.

Once the neuronal network has been trained, it is used to identify objects in new images. The network examines the image and, by processing multiple layers, extracts important characteristics that are used to identify objects of interest. Then, the network uses these characteristics to assign a label to each object detected in the image.

In summary, the identification of objects in neuronal networks is an important technique in computer vision and automatic learning used to detect and recognize objects in images and videos. It is based on the use of deep neural networks trained in datasets labeled to identify and classify objects in new images with high precision.

# Description Image classifier

The image classifier is a technique used in neural networks to classify images into different categories or labels. The objective of an image classifier is to take an input image and predict what class it belongs, based on a set of predefined categories or labels.

In deep learning, image classifiers are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are a specialized architecture to process images. These neuronal networks have multiple layers and convolution operations that allow them to extract important characteristics from the images, such as edges, shapes and textures.

To train an image classifier, a set of labeled data is used that contains images and their respective class labels. Then, the neuronal network is trained using this dataset to learn to identify patterns in the images and associate them with the corresponding class labels.

Once the neuronal network has been trained, it can be used to classify new images in different categories. The image classifier examines the input image and processes it through the neuronal network to extract important characteristics and predict what class the image belongs.

In summary, the image classifier in neuronal networks is a technique that uses convolutional neural networks to classify images into different categories or labels. It is based on the use of a dataset labeled to train the neuronal network and the extraction of important characteristics of the images to predict which class a new entrance image belongs.
