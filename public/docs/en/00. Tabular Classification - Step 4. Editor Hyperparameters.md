# Tabular classification - Hyperparameter Editor

The hyperparameter editor allows us to configure the training of the model.

We can modify all the training parameters in this section.

You can visit the glossary section to understand each of these parameters.

In our case we leave the following configuration so that the training classify performs a very fast adjustment.

1. Learning rate: 1
2. Number of epochs: 30
3. Test set size: 10 â†’ 10% 4.
4. Optimizer: Adam
5. Loss function: CategoricalCrossentropy
6. Metric function: Accuracy
