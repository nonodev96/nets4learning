# Tabular Classification - Predict (classify)

Previously, we have processed the dataset, defined the neural network layer architecture of the model, defined the training hyperparameters and trained.

Finally we can predict, which in this case is a classification.

Nets4Learning allows us to select one of the models from the list of models that we have generated, it also allows us to select an instance from which to start, in the instance selector it indicates the actual result of the classification, so we can compare it with the prediction that the classification model gives us.
classification model.

As we can see, the form has a series of dynamic fields depending on the processing of the dataset and two extra fields that are locked.

These two extra fields indicate the values to be supplied to the model, the first one is the raw data of the form and the second field is the data once the encoding operations (**label-encoder**) have been carried out to transform the string data into a numeric one.
so that the model can work.

Finally, but internally, a scaling is performed.

You can visit the documentation section to understand the programming: [example {server}](/documentation)

Finally we can observe the prediction of the model and the percentage of each of the classification classes.
