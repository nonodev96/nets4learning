# Tabular classification - Layer viewer

The layer viewer is just a visual component to represent the layers of the neural network to be generated.

The viewer has two display modes compact mode or extended mode.

In both modes the layer, the activation function and the number of neurons are displayed.

## Compact mode

This display mode is more recommended for low performance devices.

## Extended mode

In this mode you can see how each neuron is connected to all neurons in the next layer.

In the next part of the tutorial the architecture will be modified to suit the task and the dataset.
