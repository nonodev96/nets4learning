If you want to contribute to the list of models provided by n4l you can follow this guide to familiarize yourself with how the project works.

N4L provides two main interfaces, _pre-trained models_ and _train models_. These two interfaces are provided with a code that gives a common information and methods to control all.

An entry must provide the following services.

* Information
* Translations
* Original data sets
* Processed data sets
* Models
* Controllers

To add an entry (dataset and model) you must follow a few steps.

1. Search for a tabular classification data set.
2. Create the dataset folder in `/public/datasets/00-tabular-classification/<NEW_ENTRY>/`.
3. Create the folder of the models in `/public/models/00-tabular-classification/<NEW_ENTRY>/`.
4. Upload the files `<NEW_ENTRY>.csv`, `<NEW_ENTRY>.info`, `my-model-<NEW_ENTRY>.json` and `my-model-<NEW_ENTRY>.weights.bin` to their folders.
5. Create the file `<NEW_ENTRY>.js`.
6. Bind the `<NEW_ENTRY>.js` file to the project.

Follow the post of _Tabular Classification â€“ Add Entry_ to understand and create the `<NEW_ENTRY>.js` file as there are some rules to follow.
